# How to run

Run this by opening the file named 'Source.cpp' in Visual Studio(recomended) as a project. Make sure the image files(bag1.bmp,ts.bmp,yts.bmp) are in the same as folder where the project is created and also make sure glut library/dll files are installed in visual studio.
How to setup glut openGl in visual studio 2012 can be found [a link](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md)
